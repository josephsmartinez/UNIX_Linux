The Linux Foundation partners with the world's leading developers and companies to solve 
the hardest technology problems and accelerate open technology development and commercial 
adoption. 

The Linux Foundation makes it its mission to provide experience and expertise to any initiative working to solve complex problems through open source collaboration, providing the tools to scale open source projects: security best practices, governance, operations and ecosystem development, training and certification, licensing, and promotion.
Linux is the world's largest and most pervasive open source software project in history.

The Linux Foundation is home to the Linux creator Linus Torvalds and lead maintainer
Greg Kroah-Hartman, and provides a neutral home where Linux kernel development can be
 protected and accelerated for years to come.

The success of Linux has catalyzed growth in the open source community, demonstrating
the commercial efficacy of open source and inspiring countless new projects across all
industries and levels of the technology stack.

The Linux Foundation's work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at
every layer of the software stack. The Linux Foundation is the umbrella for many critical
open source projects that power corporations today, spanning all industry sectors:

Networking: OpenDaylight, OPNFV
Embedded: Dronecode
Web tools: Node.js
Cloud computing: Cloud Foundry, Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Open Container Initiative
Automotive: Automotive Grade Linux
Security: The Core Infrastructure Initiative
Finance: The Hyperledger Project
And many more.
