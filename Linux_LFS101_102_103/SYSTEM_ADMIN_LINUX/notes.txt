When talking about how files and data are organized in the one big directory tree, it is important to learn some taxonomy on what kind of information has to be read and written. In particular there are two kinds of distinctions:

Shareable vs. non-shareable
Shareable data is that which can be shared between different hosts. Non-shareable data is that which must be specific to a particular host. For example, user home directories may be shareable, while device lock files are not.

Variable vs. static
Static data include binaries, libraries, documentation, and anything that does not change without system administrator assistance. Variable data is anything that may change even without a system administrator's help.
Often these logical distinctions are embodied as different kinds of information residing in various directories, or even partitions and filesystems
