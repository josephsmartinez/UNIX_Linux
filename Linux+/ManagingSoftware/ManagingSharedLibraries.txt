Shared Libraries
    Libraries typically end in .so

    Fully qualified name:
        /usr/lib/libreadline.so.3
        /usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.18

    ldconfig name:
        /usr/lib/libreadline.so.3.0
        /usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.18.0.0

    link name:
        /usr/lib/libreadline.so
        /usr/lib64/mysql/libmysqlclient.so

    Display all shared libraries:
        ldconfig -v
        /etc/ld.so.conf
        /etc/ld.so.conf.d/mariadb-x86_64.conf

    Specify a new library location
        ldconfig -n /home/dpezet/lib
        or
        vi /etc/ld.so.conf

    Display the library dependencies of a file
        ldd /bin/bash
        ldd /bin/vim

Links
    ln

    HARDLINK, A hard link points to the data itself

    Hard link
        Default link type
        Links to a file's inode
        Can only link to files in the same filesystem
        More efficient
        ln
        ln /sbin/fsck ~/fsck

    SOFTLINK, a soft link doesn't like to the raw, hard data on the hard drive.Instead, it just links to
    a path, and on a positive side,that makes them a lot more flexible.On a negative side, it 
    means you can't move the target.If you move the target, it breaks the link.

    Soft link / symlink / Symbolic Link
        Links to a file path
            Can link to any file anywhere
            Less efficient
            ln -s /sbin/fsck ~/fsck
            
    copying vs linking

EXAMPLE:
Create a hard linked and soft linked relationship between files. Have 
one the main library update and re-link the files to point to the updated version.

hint: 
$ln -s [main file] [file link]
$ln [main file] [file link]


//MAKE SURE TO REBOOT AFTER MAKING CHANGES TO: UPDATED SOFTWARE AND LINKS ECT.
