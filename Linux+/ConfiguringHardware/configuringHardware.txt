Hardware Settings

    Hardware devices are mapped to files in /dev
        Udev <--> HAL <--> Dbus
            Udev is the system that maps hardware to files in /dev
            Provides dynamic naming so files represent hardware that is actually present
    
        HAL populates the files with XML data
        Dbus enables communications between HAL and the software process (file managers, media players, etc)
    
    Device mappings can be overridden if necessary
        /etc/udev/rules.d
        For example, say you removed eth0 and you now want eth1 to be eth0
            vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
            Correct names as required
            Reboot is generally required
    
    List loaded modules
        lsmod Calls /proc which contains a wide variety of system information cat /proc/modules
    
    Cold plug / Hot plug
    
    Loading modules
        modprobe -v Not normally needed as kmod should load them when hardware is detected modinfo
    
    List connected hardware
        lspci
        lsusb
        Both commands call /sys (the sysfs) which contains a wide variety of device information
        ls /sys/bus/pci/devices or ls /sys/bus/pci/drivers/e1000
   
   All hardware is represented in /dev
        /dev/cdrom
        /dev/cpu
        /dev/mem
        /dev/sda
        /dev/sda1
        /dev/snd
        /dev/stdout
        /dev/tty##
    
    Disabling Hardware
        Option #1: If you installed the driver, simply remove the package.
        Option #2: If it is built in to the distro, add it to the modprobe blacklist:
            Determine the module name (lsmod) vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
        Option #3: Use one of the following to temporarily remove it from memory (will return after reboot)
            rmmod
                rmmod bluetooth
                -f to force
                -w to wait until unused
            modprobe -r
