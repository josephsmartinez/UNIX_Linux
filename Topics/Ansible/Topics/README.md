# Ansible
Ansible is an open source software that **automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.**

## Continuous integration and delivery with Ansible
A major challenge in IT today is centered on enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) with no downtime. This goal has often required extensive custom code—working with multiple software packages.

## Ansible®
A powerful open source automation language. Uniquely, it’s also a deployment and orchestration tool. While Ansible provides more productive drop-in replacements for many core capabilities in other automation solutions, it also seeks to solve other major unsolved IT challenges, such as CI/CD.

## Capabilities
Ansible provides all of the needed capabilities for CI/CD in 1 solution, as it was designed from the beginning to orchestrate exactly these types of scenarios.

## Orchestration
Ansible’s unique multitier, multistep orchestration capabilities helps achieve CI/CD through:

- Rolling updates
- Continuous deployment of management content
- Integrated stage testing
- Version control-based deployment
- Embedded tests in deployment

## Why Ansible?
**Ansible is in perfect alignment with the core principles that shape Red Hat’s management, both at the product level and at the portfolio level.**

At the product level, Ansible matches Red Hat’s desire to deliver a frictionless design and a modular architecture through open development:

- Ansible is simple to use
- Ansible is modular
- Ansible is a very popular open source project
- Ansible supports multi-tier deployments
- Ansible brings consistency at multiple layers of the architecture
- Ansible supports heterogeneous IT environments
