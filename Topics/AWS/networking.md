# Networking and Traffic

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Elastic Load Balancing
automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. 

AWS Direct Connect
a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. 

Amazon Route 53
a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.

AWS VPN
lets you establish a secure and private tunnel from your network or device to the AWS global network. AWS VPN is comprised of two services: AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN.

Network ACLs
an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

AWS Shield

AWS Shield Advanced
provides enhanced detection, inspecting network flows of traffic to your protected Elastic IP address, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator or Amazon Route 53 resources. Using additional techniques like resource specific monitoring, AWS Shield Advanced uses resource and region specific granular detection of DDoS attacks.

Security Groups for VPC
lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. 

Amazon CloudFront
a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.
