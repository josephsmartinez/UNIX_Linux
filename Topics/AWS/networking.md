# Networking and Traffic

Elastic Load Balancing

AWS Direct Connect
a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. 

Amazon Route 53
a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.

AWS VPN
lets you establish a secure and private tunnel from your network or device to the AWS global network. AWS VPN is comprised of two services: AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN.

Network ACLs
an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

AWS Shield

AWS Shield Advanced
provides enhanced detection, inspecting network flows of traffic to your protected Elastic IP address, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator or Amazon Route 53 resources. Using additional techniques like resource specific monitoring, AWS Shield Advanced uses resource and region specific granular detection of DDoS attacks.
