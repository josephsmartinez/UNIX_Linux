Which one of the following setups would give us the highest level of security?

A. EC2 instances in our public subnet, no EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the IGW

B. EC2 instance in our private subnet, assigned EIPs, and route our outgoing traffic via our IGW

C. EC2 instances in our public subnet, assigned EIPs, and route outgoing traffic via the NAT

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
The EC2 instance with EIPs are directly routable from the Internet.

D. EC2 instances in our private subnet, no EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the NAT

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
EC2 instances in this example do not need to be in the public subnet, because the private subnet has access to resources in the public subnet, and therefore can access the NAT instance. That way, we can make sure those EC2 instances are hidden from public access.

You patch the operating system on an EC2 instance and issue a reboot command from inside the instance’s OS. After disconnecting from the instance and waiting several minutes, you notice that you still cannot successfully ping the instance’s public IP address. What is the most likely reason for this?

A. You were using an EC2 instance with an instance store root volume so the instance was terminated upon reboot.

B. Changes made during OS patching caused a problem with the instance’s NIC driver.

Why is this correct?
The update caused a misconfiguration internally.

C. There were pending security group rule changes that deny ICMP that could only take effect after the instance was rebooted.

Why is this incorrect?
Security group rules take effect immediately. They don't depend upon a reboot.

D. You were using EC2 Classic. The Instance’s EIP address was released at reboot.

When managing our VPC in an AWS region, we want to give other teams access to create their own instances and modify the security groups inside subnets dedicated to their teams. We have to make sure the development team can NOT do anything in their subnets that could allow their instances to impact production instances in the production subnets.

What can we do to separate out our VPC so that instances that the dev team can access can never interfere or interact with the ones within our production?

A. We can create NACLs that restrict which subnets can talk to each other

done Correct
B. We can make sure that the subnets are only allowing routing via our IGW and not the local router

C. We can create two subnets in CIDR blocks that are not close together

D. We can make sure that the dev team’s subnet are in one AZ and the production is in another

If you configure a VPC with an Internet gateway that has a private and a public subnet, with each subnet in a different Availability Zone. The VPC also has a dual-tunnel VPN between the Virtual Private Gateway and the router in the private data center. You want to make sure that you do not have a potential single point of failure in this design. What could you do to make sure we achieve this above environment?

A. There is no single point of failure with this architecture. Don't change it.

B. You create another Internet Gateway to provide redundant Internet connectivity.

C. You create and then attach a second Virtual Private Gateway, providing redundant VPN connectivity.

D. You set up a secondary router in your private data center to establish another dual-tunnel VPN connection with your Virtual Private Gateway.

Which of the following can be overridden at the EC2 instance level?

A. An IAM policy explicitly denying a user the right to terminate all EC2 instances.

B. The choice to not use dedicated tenancy at the VPC level.

done Correct
C. The choice to use dedicated tenancy at the VPC level.

Why is this incorrect?
If the option to use dedicated tenancy is explicitly set at the VPC level, it cannot be overridden at the instance level.

D. An IAM policy explicitly allowing a user the right to terminate all EC2 instances.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Explicit denies in IAM policies always trump explicit allows, so a user who is allowed to terminate all EC2 instances in an account can be denied the permission to terminate a particular instance.

What would be a reason you would upgrade to Direct Connect instead of a traditional VPN connection?

A. Direct Connect is free

B. Using Direct Connect is easier than setting up a VPN connection

C. Direct Connect gives you a greater connection speed

D. You gain higher bandwidth and consistent network connectivity
