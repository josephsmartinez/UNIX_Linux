Explicit denies in IAM policies always trump explicit allows, so a user who is allowed to terminate all EC2 instances in an account can be denied the permission to terminate a particular instance.

Rule 100 in a NACL associated with subnets A and B denies HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Rule 105 in the same NACL allows HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. EC2 Instances in subnet A are associated with a security group that allows HTTP traffic from 192.168.0.0/24. EC2 Instances in subnet B are associated with a security group that denies HTTP traffic from 128.168.0.0/24. Which of the following statements are true?

A. HTTP traffic from the internet will be allowed to EC2 instances in Subnet B.

B. HTTP traffic from 192.168.0.0/24 will be denied to EC2 instances in Subnet A because of the NACL rules.

done Correct
C. HTTP traffic from 192.168.0.0/24 will be allowed to EC2 instances in Subnet A.

D. HTTP traffic from the internet will be denied to EC2 instances in both subnets due to the NACL rules.

done Correct

When managing our VPC in an AWS region, we want to give other teams access to create their own instances and modify the security groups inside subnets dedicated to their teams. We have to make sure the development team can NOT do anything in their subnets that could allow their instances to impact production instances in the production subnets.

What can we do to separate out our VPC so that instances that the dev team can access can never interfere or interact with the ones within our production?

A. We can create NACLs that restrict which subnets can talk to each other

done Correct
B. We can make sure that the subnets are only allowing routing via our IGW and not the local router

C. We can create two subnets in CIDR blocks that are not close together

D. We can make sure that the dev team’s subnet are in one AZ and the production is in another
