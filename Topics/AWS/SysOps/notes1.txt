## Demonstrate the ability to monitor the AWS environment

1. Your company is being audited by a third party IT auditing service; they have asked you for details about the physical network and virtualization infrastructure. What do you tell them?

- White papers and attestations about AWS Compliance and Assurance Programs are available on the AWS Compliance website. You can contact a compliance representative on that site for additional questions.
https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/

2. What services can many types of security assessments or penetration tests be done against without first having to notify AWS support? (Choose all that apply)

- AWS Lambda, Lambda Edge functions, and Amazon API Gateways
- Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Lightsail resources, and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments
- Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, Amazon CloudFront, and Elastic Load Balancers
[AWS penetration-testing](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/)

3. Your EC2 instance has a system status check error with an error message of loss of network connectivity. What is the best way to attempt to resolve the EC2 status check error?

- Attempt to change the physical host the instance is on by stopping and starting the instance (EBS-backed). *This is the first thing to try since the problem is likely due to an issue on the underlying host. However, this only works for EBS-backed instances.*

- Terminate the instance and build a new one (instance store-backed)

4. Which one of the below setups would need a custom CloudWatch metric in order to be able to monitor it?

- Disk usage percentage of an Elastic Block Store volume

5. If we want to be able to monitor billing and cost metrics and send billing alerts, what AWS configuration do we need to enable and use?

A. Billing Alerts in Account Preferences

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
CloudWatch is used to monitor billing and cost metrics, BUT we are required to enable Billing Alerts in our Account Preferences before being able to create billing alerts with CloudWatch.

B. CloudFormation

C. CloudWatch Billing Metrics

D. Billing Alerts in CloudWatch

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
This needs to be enabled in Account Preferences first.

6. Which of the following CloudWatch metrics require installing an agent to populate the metric?

- Swap Usage. Since AWS cannot scan your disk volumes or run OS level commands, you need to install the CloudWatch Agent on your instance for this metric to report.
- Available Disk Space

7. We have a web application that is using Auto Scaling and an ELB. We would like to monitor the application to make sure that it maintains a good quality of service for our customers, defined by the application’s page load time. What metric within CloudWatch can we use for this?

- The latency that is reported by the ELB

8. What are some steps you can take to optimize costs on AWS?

- Detach unused EBS volumes and take a snapshot of the EBS volume. At that point, delete the EBS volume. You can easily accumulate orphan EBS volumes that are not attached to EC2 instances if you remove the default "Delete on Termination" check flag.
- Purchase reserved instances
- For RDS DB instances that consistently have 0 connections, take a snapshot of the instance and terminate the instance

9. What is the most likely reason you are being charged for an instance you launched from a free-tier eligible AMI?

- Your account has passed the one-year trial period

10.  When managing our VPC in an AWS region, we want to give other teams access to create their own instances and modify the security groups inside subnets dedicated to their teams. We have to make sure the development team can NOT do anything in their subnets that could allow their instances to impact production instances in the production subnets. What can we do to separate out our VPC so that instances that the dev team can access can never interfere or interact with the ones within our production?

- We can create NACLs that restrict which subnets can talk to each other

11. Per the AWS Acceptable Use Policy, penetration testing of EC2 instances

- May be performed in some cases by the customer against their own instances without prior authorization from AWS

12. What AWS services give you access to the underlying operating system?

- Amazon EMR

13. Your supervisor sends you a list of several processes in your AWS environment that she would like you to automate via scripts. Which of the following requires a custom script?

- Identify and replace unhealthy EC2 instances

## Demonstrate the ability to properly administer to highly available architecture in AWS

1.
Your company’s website is hosted on several EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer. Every time the development team deploys a new upgrade to the web application, the support desk begins receiving calls from customers being disconnected from their sessions. Customers’ session data is very important, as it contains their shopping cart information, and this information is lost when the customers’ sessions are disconnected. Which of the following steps can be taken together to prevent customers’ shopping cart data from being lost without affecting website availability?

A. Increase the amount of time required for the Elastic Load Balancer to recognize an EC2 instance as unhealthy.

B. Post a notification on your site’s homepage that some features will be unavailable during the upgrade.

C. Use ElastiCache to store session state.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Storing session state in ElastiCache will allow session data to be shared by all the instances, including the newly added ones.

D. Enable connection draining and remove instances from the Elastic Load Balancer prior to upgrading the application on those instances.

done Correct
2.
You manage a social media website on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. You have configured your Auto Scaling group to deploy one new EC2 instance when CPU utilization is greater than 90% for 3 consecutive periods of 10 minutes. You notice that between 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm every night, you see a gradual increase in traffic to your website. Although Auto Scaling launches several new instances every night, some users complain they are seeing timeouts when trying to load the index page during those hours. What is the least cost-effective way to resolve this problem?

A. Decrease the collection period to five minutes

B. Decrease the threshold CPU utilization percentage at which to deploy a new instance

C. Increase the minimum number of instances in the AutoScaling group

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Increasing the minimum number of instances in the AutoScaling group will keep more instances running around the clock, thus making it a very inefficient way to manage cost. The other options all increase the AutoScaling group's sensitivity to an increase in load and enable it to respond quicker to increased load by spinning up instances as soon as they become necessary.

D. Decrease the consecutive number of collection periods that must elapse before a new instance is deployed

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
This would be a cost-effective solution.

3. You have created an application that utilizes Auto Scaling behind an Elastic Load Balancer. You notice that user's sessions are not evenly distributed on the newly spun up instances. What could be a reason that your users' web sessions are stuck on one instance and not using others?

- Your ELB is sending all the sessions to the old instance and not evenly sending sessions to all new instances that are spun up during Auto Scaling because of sticky sessions

4. You support a website with a large user base concentrated on the east coast, but very few users outside of that region. Traffic load is much heavier on the site during business hours so you are planning to implement Auto Scaling to optimize the number of running EC2 instances to meet the traffic load throughout the day. You are also looking for a solution to distribute traffic evenly among those instances. Which of the following solutions will distribute traffic most evenly among the EC2 instances hosting this website in the US-East-1 region?

A. Place the instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer and enable Application Generated Cookie Stickiness.

B. Place the instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer and enable Load Balancer Generated Cookie Stickiness.

C. Set up latency-based routing in Route 53 to distribute the traffic between the EC2 instances.

D. Place the instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer with stickiness disabled.

done Correct
5.
Your MySQL RDS instance is experiencing high levels of read requests during business hours and performance is being affected. What is the first step you can do to resolve this issue?

A. Enable Automated Backups of the Database.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Enabling backups is required before enabling read replicas. https://aws.amazon.com/rds/faqs/#Read_Replicas

B. Create Read Replicas of the Database and offload some read request to the Read Replicas.

C. Pre-warm the database before read request occur.

D. Create snapshots of the Database and offload read request to the snapshots.

6. Your website is hosted on 10 EC2 instances in five regions around the globe with two instances per region. How could you configure your site to maintain availability with minimum downtime if one of the five regions was to lose network connectivity for an extended period?

- Create a Route 53 Latency Based Routing Record Set that resolves to an Elastic Load Balancer in each region and has the Evaluate Target Health flag set to true.

7. You are managing a large magazine application  inside of Amazon Web Services. Your company posts an article that gets picked up internationally, causing millions of visitors to hit your application. Such a large increase in traffic causes strain on your DB server which is servicing the blog's static content. You use EC2 instances for your web servers. How might you quickly resolve this issue and make the blog post infinitely scalable?

- Create a static HTML page using S3 and use Route 53 to point the DNS to the static S3 bucket. Since the article content is static, it can be saved as an HTML page. S3 buckets can be configured to serve static web pages.

8. You manage a popular blog website on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. You notice that between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm, you see a huge increase in traffic to your website. In addition, there are occasional random 1 to 2-hour spikes in traffic and some users are seeing timeouts when trying to load the index page during those spikes. What is the least cost-effective way to manage this Auto Scaling group?

A. Use reserved instances for the instances needed to handle the load during the daytime hours

B. Increase the maximum number of instances in the AutoScaling group

C. Use reserved instances for the instances needed to handle the typical load during the night hours

D. Use reserved instances for the instances needed to handle the load during traffic spikes

done Correct
9.
You have been asked to maintain a small AWS environment consisting of five on-demand EC2 web server instances. Traffic from the Internet is distributed to these servers via an Elastic Load Balancer. Your supervisor is not pleased with a recent AWS bill. Assuming a consistent, moderately high load on the web servers, what option should you recommend to reduce the cost of this environment without negatively affecting availability?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group to ensure that you are not paying for instances that are not needed.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
Auto Scaling can often save money in environments with variable load, but would likely not help reduce costs in an environment with a consistently high load spread across all servers.

B. Remove the Elastic Load Balancer since the instances already have public IP addresses.

C. Use spot instances rather than on-demand instances.

D. Use reserved EC2 instances rather than on-demand instances.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Reserved instances are recommended for instances with a consistently high load.

10.  You are running an application that has an IP address assigned to the EC2 instance of the application. How might you apply high availability to the instance running that application in the future?

- Assign an elastic IP address to the EC2 instance, have a backup instance running. In the event of failure, move the Elastic IP from the primary instance to the backup instance.

11. Your supervisor is concerned about losing read access to your RDS database in the unlikely event of an AWS regional failure. You design a plan to create a read replica of the database in another region, but your supervisor sees a problem with this plan. What problem does he see?

- Synchronous replication between the two regions will suffer from high latency.

12. What is a logical group of instances within a single AZ, recommended for applications that benefit from a low latency network connection?

Your applications in AWS need to authenticate against LDAP credentials that are in your on-premises data center. You need low latency between the AWS app authenticating and your credentials. How can you achieve this?

A. Create a new LDAP server and authenticate to it.

B. Create a Direct Connect tunnel which will decrease latency, increase bandwidth, and authenticate faster.

C. If you don’t already have a secure tunnel, create a VPN between your on-premises data center and AWS. You can then spin up a secondary LDAP server in AWS that replicates from the on-premises LDAP server. Authenticate against the secondary LDAP server.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Launching a second LDAP server in your VPC will give your applications on AWS the desired low latency while retaining low latency for your on-premises applications.

D. You don’t use LDAP to authenticate to your apps.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
Many applications do authenticate against credentials stored in an LDAP.

2.
You are running an EC2 instance serving a website with an SSL certificate. Your CPU utilization is constantly high. How might you resolve this issue?

A. Switch from Apache web server to Nginx for better SSL performance

B. Increase the instance size to have more CPU power

C. Offload the SSL cert to AWS ElastiCache

D. Offload the SSL cert from the EC2 instance and configure it on the Elastic Load Balancer

done Correct
3.
We need to run a business intelligence application against our production database. This application requires near real-time data from the database. How might we configure our RDS setup so that our application does not increase I/O load against our production database?

A. Copy the production instance and create a cron that dumps the RDS data into the secondary instance

B. Create a read replica from the production instance and point the application to the read replica

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Configuring your business intelligence application to run against an RDS read replica would offload these requests from the primary database.

C. Point the application to the Multi-AZ failover instance

D. In order to receive real-time information, the application must query the primary database

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
An RDS read replica receives transactions from the primary database using asynchronous replication technology. Using right-sized RDS instances, replication lag can be typically be limited to a few seconds or less.

4.
Your RDS database is experiencing high levels of read requests during the business day and performance is slowing down. You have already verified that the source of the congestion is not from backups taking place during the business day, as automatic backups are not enabled. Which of the following is the first step you can take toward resolving the issue?

A. Enable automated backups of the database.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
A read replica of the database cannot be created until automated backups are enabled. Your first step should be to enable automated backups. Once automated backups are enabled, you can proceed with creating a read replica of the database and offloading some client read requests to.

B. Pre-warm the database before gradual increases in read requests occur.

C. Create a snapshot of the database and offload some of the read requests to the snapshot.

D. Create a read replica of the database and offload some of the read requests to the read replica.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
This is the way to go, but the first step is enabling the automated backups.

5.
You have been tasked with identifying an appropriate storage solution for a single node NoSQL database that requires random I/O reads of greater than 10,000 4kB IOPS. Which EC2 options will meet this requirement?

A. EBS optimized instances

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
EBS–optimized instances deliver dedicated bandwidth to Amazon EBS, with options between 425 Mbps and 14,000 Mbps, depending on the instance type you use. Combining EBS optimized with PIOPS can give you reliable performance.

B. High Storage instance configured in RAID 10

C. EBS provisioned IOPS

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
EBS provisioned IOPS volumes can achieve up to 32,000 IOPS and 500 MB/s of throughput per volume. Combining EBS optimized with PIOPS can give you reliable performance.

D. SSD instance store

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
Unless there is active replication being done by the NoSQL database, there is a risk of data loss since SSD instance storage is ephemeral. Since this is a single node DB, data will be lost.

6.
You maintain an application on AWS to provide development and test platforms for your developers. Currently, both environments consist of an m1.small EC2 instance. Your developers notice performance degradation as they increase network load in the test environment. How would you mitigate these performance issues in the test environment?

A. Configure Amazon CloudWatch to provision more network bandwidth when network utilization exceeds 80%

B. Add an additional ENI to the test instance

C. Upgrade the m1.small to a larger instance size

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Increases in instance size give a proportional increase in network throughput.

D. Use the EBS optimized option to offload EBS traffic

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
m1.small instances do not support EBS optimization.

7.
You have enabled a CloudWatch metric on your Memcached ElastiCache cluster. Your alarm is triggered due to an increased amount of evictions. How might you go about solving the increased eviction errors from the ElastiCache cluster?

A. Add a node to the cluster

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
A high eviction rate is caused by insufficient memory on the cluster. You can add memory to the cluster by increasing the node size or adding a node to the cluster.

B. Reboot your MemCache cluster

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
Rebooting will delete all of the cached data! Performance will be impacted while the cache gets rebuilt.

C. Increase the provisioned IOPS on the ElastiCache Node

D. Increase the node size

done Correct
8.
We have a two-tiered application with the following components. We have an ELB, three web and application servers on EC2, and one MySQL RDS database. When our load grows, the database queries take longer and slow down the overall response time for the user request.

Which three options would we choose to speed up performance?

A. We can use Amazon CloudFront to cache database queries

B. We can cache our database queries with ElastiCache

done Correct
C. We can create an RDS read-replica and redirect half of the database read requests to it

done Correct
D. We can shard the database and distribute the load between shards

done Correct
9.
We have a customer with a web application that uses cookie-based sessions to see if users are logged in. This uses the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling. When the load on the application increases, Auto Scaling launches new instances so that the load on the other instances does not increase too much. However, all of the existing users still experience slow response time.

What could be the cause of this?

A. The new instances are not being added to the ELB in the process of the Auto Scale cooldown period.

B. The web app is using dynamic content features in Amazon CloudFront which is keeping our connections alive on the ELB.

C. The TTL is set too high on our ELB DNS.

D. The ELB is continuing to send the request to the web app with the previously established connections in the same backend instances rather than spreading them to the new instances.

done Correct

1.  Which of the following will cause a light I/O delay to an AWS RDS instance?

- Creating a Read Replica, Creating a Snapshot

## Demonstrate the ability to deploy and provision AWS resources

1. What are the first 2 steps of using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

2. Your company is ready to start migrating its application over to the cloud, but you cannot afford any downtime. Your manager asks you to come up with a plan of action. She also wants a solution that offers the flexibility to test the application on AWS with only a subset of users, but with the ability to increase the number of users over time. Which of these options are you most likely to recommend?

- Implement a Route53 weighted routing policy that distributes the traffic between your on-premises application and the AWS application depending on weight. This option works great because we can modify the weight of one record set over the other to increase or decrease the amount of traffic. If the application on AWS is behaving properly, we can slowly increase the number of users that get routed to that application and slowly phase out the on-premises application. Otherwise, we can revert back to the on-premises application.

D. Configure an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute the traffic between the on-premises application and the AWS application.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
You can't weight traffic with an ELB.

3.

B. You can customize your AWS deployments using JSON templates in OpsWorks Stacks.

C. You can customize your AWS deployments using the Ruby programming language with OpsWorks stacks.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Yes. OpsWorks Stacks uses chef recipes written in Ruby.

D. You can customize your AWS deployments using the Ruby programming language in CloudFormation.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
CloudFormation supports YAML or JSON syntax only.

1. Your company is setting up an application that is used to share files. Because these files are important to the sales team, the application must be highly available. Which AWS-specific storage option would you set up for low cost, reliability, and security?

- Use Amazon S3, which can be accessed by end users with signed URLs.
  - S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability over a year. Signed URLs can be used to restrict access to the application users.

5. In Autoscaling, what set of instructions tells the Auto Scaling Group how to respond to alarm messages?

Policy, When you configure dynamic scaling, you must define how you want to scale in response to changing demand. For example, you have a web application that currently runs on two instances and you do not want the CPU utilization of the Auto Scaling group to exceed 70 percent. You can configure your Auto Scaling group to scale automatically to meet this need. The policy type determines how the scaling action is performed.

6.

11. You have been tasked by your manager to build a tiered storage setup for database backups and their logs. These backups must be archived to a durable solution. After 10 days, the backups can then be archived to a lower priced storage tier. The data, however, must be retained for compliance policies. Which tiered storage solution would help you save cost, and still meet this compliance policy?

- Set up an independent EBS volume where we can store daily backups and then copy these files over to S3, where we configure a bucket that has a lifecycle policy to archive files older than 10 days to AWS Glacier

12. You have enabled a CloudWatch metric on your Redis ElastiCache cluster. Your alarm is triggered due to an increased amount of evictions. What is one way you might go about solving the increased eviction errors from the ElastiCache cluster?

- If you exceed your chosen threshold, scale your cache cluster out and add read replicas

## Demonstrate the ability to use key concepts to secure an AWS environment

1. Which of the following is a security best practice for an AWS environment?

- Enable MFA on the root user for your AWS account and use IAM users rather than the root user for administrative tasks. Root user privileges cannot be restricted.

2. Which features can be used to restrict access to data in S3?

- Create a CloudFront distribution for the bucket and limit permissions to just the Cloudfront OAI. Generate signed URLs for getting and putting objects. CloudFront's user, known as an Origin Access Identity, will have access to the bucket, but direct access to the bucket by the public will be denied.
- Set an S3 ACL on the bucket or the object. ACLs are commonly used for cross account access. You can use ACLs to grant READ, WRITE or FULL CONTROL access to AWS accounts and S3 groups.
- Set an S3 bucket policy.

3. You have an Amazon VPC that has a private subnet and a public subnet in which you have a NAT instance server. You have created a group of EC2 instances that configure themselves at startup by downloading a bootstrapping script from S3 that deploys an application via GIT. Which one of the following setups would give us the highest level of security?

- EC2 instances in our private subnet, no EIPs, route outgoing traffic via the NAT

4. How might you assign permissions to an EC2 instance so that the EC2 custom CloudWatch metric scripts can send the required data to Amazon CloudWatch?

- Assign an IAM role to the EC2 instance at creation time or later with permissions to write to CloudWatch. Roles are assigned when creating the EC2 instance or later on via the CLI or console. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/easily-replace-or-attach-an-iam-role-to-an-existing-ec2-instance-by-using-the-ec2-console/

5. What is the result of the following bucket policy?

A deny overrides an allow in which circumstances?

A. A NACL associated with subnet A defines two rules. Rule #100 explicitly denies TCP traffic on port 21 from 0.0.0.0/0 and rule #105 explicitly allows TCP traffic on port 21 from 0.0.0.0/0.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
NACL rules are processed in order, so the Allow is never read.

B. A NACL associated with subnet B defines two rules. Rule #105 explicitly denies TCP traffic on port 21 from 0.0.0.0/0 and rule #100 explicitly allows TCP traffic on port 21 from 0.0.0.0/0.

C. An explicit allow is set in an IAM policy governing S3 access and an explicit deny is set on an S3 bucket via an S3 bucket policy.

done Correct

Why is this correct?
IAM and bucket policies are combined in this case.

D. S3 bucket access is implicitly denied for all users and an explicit allow is set on an S3 bucket via an S3 bucket policy.

7. Your company's compliance department mandates that within your multi-national organization, all data for customers in the UK must never leave UK servers and networks. Similarly, US data must never leave US servers and networks without explicit authorization first. What do we have to do to comply with this requirement in our web-based applications running on AWS in EC2? The user has already set up a user profile that states their geographic location.

A. We can run EC2 instances in multiple regions and leverage Route 53’s latency-based routing capabilities to route traffic to the appropriate region based on a user’s profile.

B. We can run our EC2 instances within multiple AWS Availability Zones in a single region, and use Elastic Load Balancers with session stickiness to route our traffic to the appropriate zone based on the user’s profile.

C. We can run EC2 instances in multiple regions, and leverage a third-party data provider to determine whether a user should be redirected to the appropriate region based on that user’s profiles.

You manage EC2 instances in two different VPCs and you would like instances in both VPCs to be able to easily communicate with each other. You are considering using VPC peering. Will this work?

A. Yes, as long as all EC2 instances have a public IP.

B. Yes, as long as the VPCs’ CIDR blocks don’t overlap.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
That is correct. Peering is not allowed if the VPCs have overlapping IP ranges. The VPCs can now be in different regions.

C. Yes, as long as the VPCs are in the same account.

D. Yes, as long as the VPC’s are in the same region.

1. What item, when attached to a VPC, will allow an internal subnet to communicate to external networks?

- Virtual Private Gateway, A Virtual Private Gateway connect your VPC to private networks in your data center.
- Internet Gateway (IGW)

3.
If you configure a VPC with an Internet gateway that has a private and a public subnet, with each subnet in a different Availability Zone. The VPC also has a dual-tunnel VPN between the Virtual Private Gateway and the router in the private data center. You want to make sure that you do not have a potential single point of failure in this design. What could you do to make sure we achieve this above environment?

A. There is no single point of failure with this architecture. Don't change it.

forum
Why is this incorrect?
The router in the data center is a single point of failure.

B. You create another Internet Gateway to provide redundant Internet connectivity.

C. You create and then attach a second Virtual Private Gateway, providing redundant VPN connectivity.

D. You set up a secondary router in your private data center to establish another dual-tunnel VPN connection with your Virtual Private Gateway.

done Correct
forum
Why is this correct?
Yes. The router is a single point of failure.

4. Your infrastructure does not have an Internet Gateway attached to the VPC. What might you do in order to SSH into your EC2 instances? All other configurations are correct.

1. Rule 100 in a NACL associated with subnets A and B denies HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. Rule 105 in the same NACL allows HTTP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0. EC2 Instances in subnet A are associated with a security group that allows HTTP traffic from 192.168.0.0/24. EC2 Instances in subnet B are associated with a security group that denies HTTP traffic from 128.168.0.0/24. Which of the following statements are true?

- HTTP traffic from 192.168.0.0/24 will be denied to EC2 instances in Subnet A because of the NACL rules.
  - The NACL is blocking HTTP traffic from all addresses.
- HTTP traffic from the internet will be denied to EC2 instances in both subnets due to the NACL rules.
  - NACL rules are processed in order, so the first rule will block the traffic.

6. You have decided to extend your on-site data center to Amazon Web Services by creating a VPC. You already have multiple DNS servers on-premises. You are using these DNS servers to host DNS records for your internal applications. You have a corporate security network policy that says that a DNS name for an internal application can only be resolved internally and never publicly over the internet. Your existing on-premises data center is already connected to your VPC using IPSec VPN.

How can you setup your VPC to use your on-prem DNS servers?

A. Create a new Route 53 hosted zone and forward your internal DNS queries out to the Internet.

B. Using Route 53 hosted zones, you can use all internal domain names' A record sets.

close Your Answer
forum
Why is this incorrect?
The corporate security policy says the DNS resolution must be handled internally, so Route 53 is out.

C. Create secondary DNS servers on a Linux server and replicate from primary DNS servers on your on-premises

D. Create a DHCP option set, add your on-prem DNS servers to it, and replace the option set on your VPC with the newly-created option set.
