# Development and Code

AWS Elastic Beanstalk
an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

Lambda
lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.
