### 1. What is a relation?
**Is a two dimension table in which**  
- The entries in the table are single-valued (each location in the table contains only one value)
- Each column has a distinct name
- All values in a column are values of the same attribute
- The order of columns is immaterial
- Each row is distinct
- The order of rows is immaterial

### 2. What is a relational database?
- A collection of relations

### 3. What is an unnormalized relation? Is it a relation according to the definition of the word relation?
- No because...
- unnormalized **entries** contain repeating groups are not single-valued.
- unnormalized relations data can repeat within a column

### 4. How is the term attribute used in the relation model? What is a more common name for attribute?
- attributes are sometime referred as fields  

### 5. Describe the shorthand representation of the structure of a relational database. Illiterate this technique by representing the database for Colonial Adventure Tours shown in Figures 1-15 through 1-19 in Chapter 1.
- `Guide (GuideNum, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State, PostalCode, PhoneNum, HireDate)`

### 6. What does it mean to qualify a field name? How would you qualify the Street field in the Customer table?
- When duplicate column name exist in a database you need a way to indicate the column to which you are referring to.
- Thus you can write the `RepNum` column in the `Customer` table as `Customer.RepNum` and the `RepNum` column in the `Rep` table as `Rep.RepNum`
- When you combine column name with a table name, you say that you **qualify** the column
- `Customer.Street`

### 7. What is a primary key? What is the primary key for each table in the Colonial Adventure Tours database shown in Figures 1-15 through 1-19 in Chapter 1.
- The **primary key** of a table is the column or collection of columns that uniquely identifies a given row in that table.
- Guide table's primary key -> `GuideNum`
- Primary key's denoted with an **underline**
- Guide (__GuideNum__, LastName, FirstName, Address, City, State, PostalCode, PhoneNum, HireDate)

### 8. How do you include a field in an Access Query?
- Double click the field in the field list to place it in the design grid

### 9. How do you indicate criteria in a Access Query?
- Conditions that data must satisfy

### 10. How do you use an AND criterion to combine criteria in an Access query?
- You can use the **comparison operators** to create conditions.
- You can also combine criteria to create **compound criteria** or **compound conditions**
- **AND** or **OR**

### 11. How create a computer field in the access query?
- A **computed field** or **calculated field** is a field that is the result of a calculation using one or more existing fields.

### 12. In which row of the Access design grid do you include functions? What functions can you use in Access queries?
- Count, Sum, Avg, Max, Min, StDev, Var, First, Last...etc.

### 13. How do you sort data in an Access query?
- The field on which records are sorted is called the **sort key**, you sort using more than one field
- Ascending, Descending, etc.  

### 14. When sorting data on more than one field in a Access query, which field is the major sort key? Which field is the minor sort key? What effect do these keys have on the order in which the rows are displayed.
- The sorting field is called the **major key** and the second is called the **minor key**

### 15. How do you join tables in an Access query?
- join table is need when selecting data from more than one table
- it is necessary to join the tables based on matching fields in corresponding columns

### 16. How do you use an update query?
- An update query makes a specified change to all records satisfying the criteria in the query

### 17. When do you use a delete query?
- You can use delete query to delete one or more records at a time based on the criteria that you specify

### 18. When do you use a make-table query?
- The records added to the new table are separate from the original table in which they appear

### 19. What is relational algebra?
- Relation algebra is a theoretical way of manipulating a relational database
- It includes operations that act on existing tables to produce new tables

### 20. Describe the purpose of the SELECT command in relational algebra?
- **SELECT** takes a horizontal subset of a table and retrieves certain rows from existing table

### 21. Describe the purpose of the PROJECT command in relational algebra?
- Known as the **Cartesian product** is the table obtained by concatenating every row in the first table with every row in the second table

### 22. Describe the purpose of the JOIN command in relational algebra?
- The **join** operation is the core operation of relation algebra because it is the command that allows you extract data from more than table
- Two table are combined base on match columns

### 23. Describe the purpose of the UNION command in relational algebra?
- Two table are **union compatible** when they have the same number of columns and when their corresponding columns represent the same type of data

### 24. Are there any restrictions on the tables when using the UNION command? If so, what are these restrictions?
- Two tables must have same structure for a union to be appropriate

### 25. Describe the purpose of the INTERSECT command in relational algebra?
- Similar to the UNION command, just replace with INTERSECT

### 26. Describe the purpose of the SUBTRACT command in relational algebra?
- Opposite to the UNION and INTERSECT command in that, SUBTRACT acts like exclusion of two sets

### 27. Describe the purpose of the product in relational algebra?
- Table obtained by concatenating every row in the first table with every row in the second table

### 28. Describe the results of the division process in relational algebra?
- The division of a table with two columns be a table with one column, with the quotient being the new table with a single column. PG 62 best illiterates this process

## Critical Thinking
### 29. In the TAL Distributors database shown in Figure 2-1, the Rep table contains four rows and the customer table contains 12 rows. How many rows would be contained in the Cartesian product of these two tables?
- Rep X Customer = 48 elements

### 30. In Example 23 on page 58, would you get the same result if you preformed the PROJECT command before the JOIN command? Why or why not?
- It would not work because you do not have all of the columns available produced by the join command which gives you one table. You can try call the product command over customers or rep, but considering the tables have not been joined yet you would not be able to get the Cartesian product of (customerNum, customer name, rep, last name) and thus *not* having the resulting one-table without first names as produced in the example.
