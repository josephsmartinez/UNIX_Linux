The Bastille Hardening program "locks down" an operating system, proactively configuring the system for increased security and decreasing its susceptibility to compromise. Bastille can also assess a system's current state of hardening, granularly reporting on each of the security settings with which it works.

psad is a collection of three lightweight system daemons (two main daemons and one helper daemon) that run on Linux machines and analyze Netfilter log messages to detect port scans and other suspicious traffic. More information can be found here.
