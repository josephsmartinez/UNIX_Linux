# Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)


## About

A DoS attack is a denial of service attack where a computer (or computers) is used to flood a server with TCP and UDP packets. During this type of attack, the service is put out of action as the packets sent overload the serverâ€™s capabilities and make the server unavailable to other devices and users throughout the network. 

A DDoS attack is one of the most common types of DoS attack in use today. During a DoS attack, multiple systems target a single system with a DoS attack. The targeted network is then bombarded with packets from multiple locations.

A SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

Slowloris is a type of denial of service attack tool invented by Robert "RSnake" Hansen which allows a single machine to take down another machine's web server with minimal bandwidth and side effects on unrelated services and ports.

DrDoS stands for Distributed Reflection Denial of Service attack. DrDoS techniques usually involve multiple victim machines that unwittingly participate in a DDoS attack on the attacker's target. Requests to the victim host machines are redirected, or reflected, from the victim hosts to the target.
