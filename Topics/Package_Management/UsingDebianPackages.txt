CompTIA Linux+ LX0-103 - 102 Managing Software
In this episode, Daniel and Don explain package management when using Debian Linux distributions. They describe the different Debian package management systems like dpkg, apt-get, dselect, and aptitude; how to use them to install, configure, and remove software from your Linux system.

102.4 Use Debian Package Management

Using Debian Packages
    Debian Distributions and Conventions
    Originates with the Debian distro
        Adopted to other Linux distros (Ubuntu, Mint, Xandros)
    
Debian supports many different CPU architectures
    x86, x86-64, IA-64, ARM, PowerPC, Alpha, 680x0, MIPS, and SPARC
    x86 native

The dpkg Command Set
Syntax
    dpkg [options][action] [package-files|package-name]
    action is the action to be taken by dpkg
        -i or --install
        --configure (Reconfigures an installed package)
        -r or --remove
        -P or --purge (removes package and configs)
        --get-selections (Lists installed packages)
        -p or --print-avail (Info about installed)
        -I or --info (Info about installable)
        -l or --list List packages that match the pattern

Using apt-cache

Provides info about the Debian package database

apt-cache showpkg [package name]
    Displays package info

apt-cache stats
    Shows package statistics
    How many packages are installed, dependencies

apt-cache unmet
    Finds unmet dependencies

apt-cache depends [package]
    Displays specific package dependencies
    rdepends finds packages that depend on the one you specify
    
apt-cache pkgnames [string]
    Lists installed packages that begin with the specified string

Using apt-get
Similar to the YUM utility
Gets packages from a package repository
    Repositories are defined in /etc/apt/sources.list
    
apt-get update
    Gets package info updates

apt-get upgrade
    Upgrades all install packages

apt-get dist-upgrade
    Upgrades all packages except those that would break a dependent package

apt-get install
    Installs a package

apt-get remove
    Removes a package

Options to use with apt-get
    -d/--download-only doesn't install
    -f/--fix-broken attempts to fix broken depend
    -q/--quiet no output or progress info
    -y/--yes/--assume-yes answers all with yes
    --no-upgrade won't upgrade if older version already installed

Using dselect, aptitude, and Synaptic
Show demos of dselect, aptitude, and Synaptic
Reconfiguring Packages
Linux programs tend to be configured through the use of configuration files
Sometimes you can mess things up when trying to configure the config files

You can reconfigure the config files back to their original state using
    # dpkg-reconfigure [program-name]

Debian Packages Compared to Other Package Formats
Debian packages aren't single files, they're groups of files...
    The Source Tarball
    Patch file (used to modify the source code)
    A .dcs file (contains the digital signature)

Debian packages tend to be more compatible with any Debian derived distro
More obscure programs might not be available in Debian package
Configuring Debian Package Tools

Debian packages usually don't require you to configure them at install
    The Debian system has set defaults that work most of the time

Still, from time-to-time config might be needed
If you need to add config info then...

Main configuration file for dpkg is located at
    /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg or ~/.dpkg.cfg
    Edit this file to include needed arguments

Main configuration file for APT is located at
    /etc/apt/apt.conf (works for DSELECT too)
    SHOW THIS sample config file
    /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf

Package tools rely on various files found in the /var/lib/dpkg directory
    This is basically the database of install files
    Handle with care ;)
